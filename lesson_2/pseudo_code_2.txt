# Pseudo-code: a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that
is all those strings concatenated together  #

# Casual #

Given a collection of strings

Iterate through the collection one by one
 - save the first value as the starting value
 - for each iteration, reassign the saved value as itself plus the current value

After iterating through the collection, return the saved value


-------------------------------------------------------------

# Formal #

START

# Given a collection of strings called "words"

SET iterator = 1
SET saved_word = value within the words collection at space 1

WHILE iterator < length of words
  SET iterator = iterator + 1
  SET current_word = value within words collection at space "iterator"
  SET saved_word = saved_word + current_word

PRINT saved_word

END
