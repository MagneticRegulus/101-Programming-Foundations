# Pseudo-code: a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array
with every other element  #

# Casual #

Given a collection of integers

Iterate through the collection one by one
  - save a new collection as empty
  - for each iteration, check if the current iteration is an even or odd iteration
  - if the current iteration is an even iteration
    - move to the next iteration
  - otherwise
    - add the current value to the end of the new collection

After iterating through the collection, return the new collection

-------------------------------------------------------------

# Formal #

START

# Given a collection of integers called "numbers"

SET iterator = 1
SET new_collection = empty

WHILE iterator < length of numbers
  IF iterator = an even number
    go to the next iteration
  ELSE
    add the value within number at space "iterator - 1" to new_collection
  SET iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT new_collection

END
