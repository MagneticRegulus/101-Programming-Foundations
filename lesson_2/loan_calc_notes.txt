Take everything you've learned so far and build a mortgage calculator (or car payment
calculator -- it's the same thing).

You'll need three pieces of information:

    the loan amount
    the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
    the loan duration

From the above, you'll need to calculate the following two things:

    monthly interest rate
    loan duration in months

You can use the following formula:

m = p * (j / (1 - (1 + j)**(-n)))

    m = monthly payment
    p = loan amount
    j = monthly interest rate
    n = loan duration in months

### Notes ###

Welcome the user to the progamme
request their name and validate
  its not nil
ask for loan information
  request the total loan amount in $$$
    validate
      its not empty
      its not zero
      its not negative
  request the APR in a whole number (5% not 0.05)
    validate
      its not empty
      its not zero
      its not negative
    confirm its the rate the user wanted
        if not, request again
  request the loan duration in years
    validate
      its not empty
      its not zero
      its not negative
  calculate (annual interest rate / 12) / 100 = monthly interest rate
  calculate loan duration in years * 12 = loan duration in months
  calculate monthly payment = total loan amount * (monthly interest rate / (1 - (1 + mir)**(-1 * ld in months)))
  show monthly payment in $$$
  ask if user would like to recalculate the loan
    if yes, go to request total loan amount
Say goodbye to user
